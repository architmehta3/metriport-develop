        **Before You Start...**

        âœ‹ If you'd like to report a security bug/vulnerability, please [report a vulnerability](https://github.com/metriport/metriport/security/advisories/new) instead.

        This form is only for submitting feature requests.

        We recomment to search for [existing issues](https://github.com/metriport/metriport/issues) - it helps to give each issue the proper attention and priority. However, if you find an old, closed issue, it's better to open a new one and make a reference to the closed one.

        You can use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to format lists and code.

        Thanks for taking the time to fill this out!
