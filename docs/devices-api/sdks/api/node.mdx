description: "Access the Devices API using our Node SDK"
---

We've developed an SDK to help you get access to our API without the HTTP plumbing. It's currently only available for
Node-based applications ([let us know](https://www.metriport.com/contact-us) what other languages you'd like to see it available on).

The SDK is available as an NPM package and you can access it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metriport/api-sdk) - it's written
in Typescript, and includes strong typing for all of our [data models](/devices-api/more-info/models).

To install:

```shell
npm install --save @metriport/api-sdk
```

Initialize it like so:

<Snippet file="devices-api-init.mdx" />

Some examples of usage, once the API client is initialized:

```typescript
// create user in Metriport and get the Metriport user ID
const metriportUserId = await metriportClient.getMetriportUserId("your-internal-user-id");

// create a session token to be used in the Metriport Connect widget
const connectToken = await metriportClient.getConnectToken(metriportUserId);

// query for body data after the user has connected a device
const response = await metriportClient.getBodyData(metriportUserId, "2023-01-01");
```

The operations available follow the [API Reference specification](/devices-api/api-reference).

The client source code contain only the exposed operations and is available
[here](https://github.com/metriport/metriport/blob/master/packages/api-sdk/src/devices/client/metriport.ts).
