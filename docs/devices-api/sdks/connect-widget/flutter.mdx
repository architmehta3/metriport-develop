<Info>
  If you haven't already, and you're developing on iOS, visit the [Apple Health
  docs](/devices-api/getting-started/apple-health#1-enable-healthkit) and follow the "Enable HealthKit"
  section to configure HealthKit.
</Info>

## Installation

```sh
flutter pub add metriport_flutter
```

You'll need to ensure that the `MetriportSDK` pod is installed as well.

```sh
cd ios
pod install
```

<Snippet file="metriport-sdk-appdelegate.mdx" />

## Usage

To use our SDK go to the root of your project and add:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:metriport_flutter/metriport_flutter.dart';

void main() => runApp(const WebViewExample());

class WebViewExample extends StatelessWidget {
  const WebViewExample({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Flutter WebView example')),
        body: const Column(
          children: [
            Expanded(
              child: WebView(
                clientApiKey: "CLIENT_API_KEY",
                token: "CONNECT_TOKEN",
                colorMode: "dark",
                customColor: "green",
                sandbox: false,
                providers: ["fitbit", "cronometer"],
              ),
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Ensure you use your Client Key here, and not your Secret Key. You can read more about the
  differences between the two in our [API Keys guide](/home/api-info/api-keys).
</Warning>

<Info>
  As per the guide, we recommend to store your Client Key in environment secrets, and not commit it
  in plain text to your repository.
</Info>

<Info>
  As per the Quickstart guide, you'll need to generate a token on your server before opening the
  Connect Widget. You can read more about this
  [here](/devices-api/getting-started/connect-quickstart#4-link-to-the-metriport-connect-widget-in-your-app).
