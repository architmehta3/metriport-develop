description: "A library to integrate with Metriport on React Native - including Apple Health integrations."
---

<Info>
  If you haven't already, and you're developing on iOS, visit the [Apple Health
  docs](/devices-api/getting-started/apple-health#1-enable-healthkit) and follow the "Enable
  HealthKit" section to configure HealthKit.
</Info>

<Warning>
  If you're using Expo Go, you'll need to prebuild your app to use this library. You can read more
  about this [here](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/). **Note that Apple Health lives on
  the user's device, and requires the native bridge to work. So, Apple Health integrations simply
  won't work on Expo Go by default, and this is true of any other library/vendor.**
</Warning>

## Installation

```sh
npm install @metriport/react-native-sdk
npm install react-native-webview
```

You'll need to ensure that the `MetriportSDK` pod is installed as well.

```sh
cd ios
pod install
```

<Info>
  As pod versions are updated, you may need to run `pod update MetriportSDK` in the `ios` directory
  to get the latest version. To verify latest, go to
  https://github.com/metriport/metriport-ios-sdk/releases.
</Info>

<Info>
  If using Expo, your `Info.plist` file may be getting overwritten in the prebuild. If this is the
  case, you'll need to add the following to your `app.json` file:
  ```json
  {
    "expo": {
      "ios": {
        "infoPlist": {
          "NSHealthShareUsageDescription": "<< your usage description here >>",
          "NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription": "<< your usage description here >>"
        },
        "entitlements": {
          "com.apple.developer.healthkit": true,
          "com.apple.developer.healthkit.background-delivery": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</Info>

## Usage

To use our SDK go to the root of your project and add:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

import { StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import { MetriportWidget } from "@metriport/react-native-sdk";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MetriportWidget
      token="CONNECT_TOKEN"
      clientApiKey="CLIENT_API_KEY"
      sandbox={false}
      style={styles.box}
    />
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
  },
});
```

<Warning>
  Ensure you use your Client Key here, and not your Secret Key. You can read more about the
  differences between the two in our [API Keys guide](/home/api-info/api-keys).
</Warning>

<Info>
  As per the guide, we recommend to store your Client Key in environment secrets, and not commit it
  in plain text to your repository.
</Info>

<Info>
  As per the Quickstart guide, you'll need to generate a token on your server before opening the
  Connect Widget. You can read more about this
  [here](/devices-api/getting-started/connect-quickstart#4-link-to-the-metriport-connect-widget-in-your-app).
