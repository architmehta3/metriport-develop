  If you haven't already, visit the [Apple Health docs](/devices-api/getting-started/apple-health#1-enable-healthkit) and follow
  the "Enable HealthKit" section to configure HealthKit.
</Info>

## Installation

Our packages can be downloaded using SPM (Swift Package Manager).
To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select `File > Add Packages` and enter our repo URL:

```
https://github.com/metriport/metriport-ios-sdk
```

<img className="h-100" src="/images/package-install.png" />

<Info>
  We recommend using the latest available package release version - you can [find the latest release
  version in our GitHub repo](https://github.com/metriport/metriport-ios-sdk/releases).
</Info>

Now, let's setup the `MetriportSDK` package to receive background updates.

<Snippet file="metriport-sdk-appdelegate.mdx" />

## Usage

To use our SDK go to the root of your project and add:

```swift
import MetriportSDK

var healthStore = MetriportHealthStoreManager(clientApiKey: "CLIENT_API_KEY", sandbox: false);
```

Next, initialize the `MetriportWidget` inside of a view to display it. See the following
snippet for an example initialization from a button tap, that then displays the Connect Widget
in a sheet:

```swift
class WidgetController: ObservableObject {
    @Published var showWidget = false;
    var token = "";

    func openWidget(token: String) {
        self.showWidget = true
        self.token = token
    }

}

struct ContentView: View {
    // Manages the Metriport Widget
    @ObservedObject var widgetController = WidgetController()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button {
                // This is an example, you'll need to get a session token from your server.
                let token = "TOKEN"
                widgetController.openWidget(token: token);
            } label: {
                Text("Open Metriport Widget")
            }
            .sheet(isPresented: $widgetController.showWidget) {
                MetriportWidget(
                    healthStore: healthStore,
                    token: widgetController.token,
                    sandbox: false)
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

<Warning>
  Ensure you use your Client Key here, and not your Secret Key. You can read more about the
  differences between the two in our [API Keys guide](/home/api-info/api-keys).
</Warning>

<Info>
  As per the guide, we recommend to store your Client Key in environment secrets, and not commit it
  in plain text to your repository.
</Info>

<Info>
  As per the Quickstart guide, you'll need to generate a token on your server before opening the
  Connect Widget. You can read more about this
  [here](/devices-api/getting-started/connect-quickstart#4-link-to-the-metriport-connect-widget-in-your-app).
